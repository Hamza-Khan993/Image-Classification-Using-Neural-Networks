# Image-Classification-With-Logistic-Regression-Using-PyTorch
In this Project, we'll use PyTorch and linear regression to solve a very 
different kind of problem: image classification. We'll use the famous 
MNIST Handwritten Digits Database as our training dataset. It consists of 28px by 28px
grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), along with labels for each image
indicating which digit it represents. Here are some sample images from the dataset:
